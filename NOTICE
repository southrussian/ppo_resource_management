## Modifications to Original Code

The file `maddpg_run.py` is based on `maddpg_original.py` from the AgileRL library. Key modifications include:

1. Environment: Changed from Space Invaders to a custom Surgery Quota Scheduler.
2. Observation and Action Spaces: Adapted to the new environment.
3. Hyperparameters: Adjusted for the new problem domain.
4. Metrics and Logging: Added TensorBoard logging and additional performance metrics.
5. Reward Function: Modified to suit the new environment.
6. Training Loop: Adjusted for the specific requirements of the Surgery Quota Scheduler.

These modifications integrate the MADDPG algorithm from AgileRL into our custom environment for surgery scheduling optimization.
